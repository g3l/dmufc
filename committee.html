                                            <h3>Felix Oates</h3>
                                            This year was always going to be a transition year with a large part of the club leaving last year and with it, most of the
                                            first team, most of committee and a lot of big social members. With that in mind,
                                            I think everyone’s been a credit to the club on the pitch and off. Having seen
                                            first hand from Elliot, the club simply wouldn’t have had the year it has had.
                                            However, as is the case every year regardless of the tireless efforts of everyone
                                            involved, there is always things to improve on and I plan to take things forward.

                                            We’re your social secs this year. We both have been fully committed to this club on and off the pitch for the last 2 years
                                            beginning as freshers. Whether it’s a big game on match day or a heavy Wednesday
                                            night out we are always up for it. This role takes a large amount of responsibility.
                                            Our job is to get as many people involved with the social side of the club as
                                            possible. You don't have to play to come along to our socials. It’s a great place
                                            to find some guys with a similar interest to yourself. Tour – As you all know
                                            Tour is a massive part of DMUFC and everyone that goes loves it, sun, beaches
                                            and pool parties. It’s a sick week. We’ll tell you more later.

                                            Being secretary is quite a boring position because it takes some sort of responsibility, helping the chairman with all the
                                            behind the scenes arrangements that we don't see. I would consider myself as
                                            quite an organised person and I hope that members at the club could testify to
                                            that. As secretary, I work closely with the chairman and have to be reliable.

                                            The experience I’ve had with the club lead me to believe that I could become a valuable member of the club as Media Sec.
                                            This role is clearly a huge responsibility, being in charge of the club’s social
                                            media platforms and therefore advertising social events, as well as game days
                                            and various other things. I felt this is a role that I would fit perfectly into,
                                            as I study Media Production anyway, meaning many of the skills this role requires,
                                            I already possess.

                                            I first joined this great club September 2015, 2 seasons, 2 varsity wins. I'm in my final year at uni, and the final chance
                                            for me to represent the club I love! Having lived with the former kits and equipment
                                            Mr Eyre last year I have seen first hand exactly what is required for the role
                                            and am absolutely certain I have what it takes to continue the hard work of Elliott
                                            and co! Considering I rarely remember the walk to marz the club has provided
                                            me with thousands of great memories and This is my chance to give something back!

                                            health and Safety officer Connor Byrne to the limit by ending up in an ambulance-
                                            ask me how i did that. So whether that counts as experience is for you to decide.

                                            I’ve been at this great club for two years, winning 2 varsities in the process under 2 very passionate managers. From scoring
                                            the perfect hat trick in my first varsity to fraudulently missing a pen in my
                                            2nd, Can’t wait to see what happens in the next one. What a time to be alive.
                                            <br> Intresting Fact: Was voted clubman of the year last year, Don't know how I frauded
                                            my way into winning it.
                                            <h3>Taylor Bright</h3>
                                            This club has made my first year at uni what it's been. It was always my intention to play football and join the society,
                                            but I never thought it would be close to how good it’s actually been, from getting
                                            written off every Wednesday on those dirty pitchers to the scenes at varsity
                                            winning on penalties, and i can’t wait to do it all next year.
                                            <br> Intresting Fact: Gambian Phil. If you know, you know.

                                            I joined DMUFC in my 2nd year of university and my time as a fresher couldn't have been more fun and memorable, captaining
                                            6th team and being club member of the year for my contribution to the club are
                                            among some of my favourite achievements at DMUFC. I wanted to become 6th team
                                            manager to continue tradition and fun times experienced at dmufc and to make
                                            the team better.
                                            <br> Intresting Fact: Once did 11 shots of Sambuca in 21 seconds
                                            <h3>Jonny Lacey</h3>
                                            Since joining DMUFC, I've played for both 7th and 6th team and then went on to manage 6ths in my 3rd year at uni. I can honestly
                                            say being part of DMUFC, both playing and the social aspects, has made my time
                                            and uni unforgettable. I wanted to manage the 6ths to pass on all that I had
                                            learnt and welcome as many into the club as possible.
                                            <br> Intresting Fact: On my first social jevons threw up on me in marz after doing
